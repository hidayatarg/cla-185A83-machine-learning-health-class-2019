In the seventh lecture we wil discuss causality and causal inference in machine learning for decision support. Last but not least we will  discuss ethical, governmental, legal and social issues of AI in health informatics, which actually fits very good to the topic of explainability and causality.

Topic 01: Making inferences from observational and unobservational variables and reasoning under uncertainty [1]
Topic 02: Factuals, Counterfactuals [2], Counterfactual Machine Learning and Causal Models [3]
Topic 03: Probabilistic Causality Examples
Topic 04: Causality in time series (Granger Causality)
Topic 05: Psychology of causation
Topic 06: Causal Inference in Machine Learning
Topic 07: Ethical, legal and social issues of AI in health informatics

On February, 3, 2018 there was a large event at the MIT: The Ethics and Governance of AI opening event, February 3, 2018, students should watch the video from this event:
