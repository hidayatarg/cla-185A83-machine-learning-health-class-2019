In the seventh lecture we have discussed again causality and causal inference in machine learning for decision support. Due to its imporantance we have discussed ethical, governmental, legal and social issues of AI in health informatics, which actually fits very good to the topic of explainability and causality.

Topic 01: Causality
Topic 02: Explainability and Causability
Topic 03: AI Ethics
Topic 04: Social Issues of Artificial Intelligence in health informatics

Very important is that we clearly define the terms what we mean, including:

What is ethics? What is trust? What is fairness? How can we measure trust? How can we measure fairness?
What is transparency? How can we ensure transparency in machine learning?


On February, 3, 2018 there was a large event at the MIT: The Ethics and Governance of AI opening event, February 3, 2018, students should watch the video from this event:
