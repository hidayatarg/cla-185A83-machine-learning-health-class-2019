Lecture Outline: 
In order to get well prepared for the second tutorial on probabilistic programming, this module provides some basics on graphical models and goes towards methods for Monte Carlo sampling from probability distributions based on Markov Chains (MCMC). This is not only very important, it is awesome, as it is similar as our brain may work. It allows for computing hierachical models having a large number of unknown parameters and also works well for rare event sampling wich is often the case in the health informatics domain.  So, we start with reasoning under uncertainty, provide some basics on graphical models and go towards graph model learning. One particular MCMC method is the so-called Metropolis-Hastings algorithm which obtains a sequence of random samples from high-dimensional probability distributions -which we are often challenged in the health domain. The algorithm is among the top 10 most important algorithms and is named after Nicholas METROPOLIS (1915-1999) and Wilfred K. HASTINGS (1930-2016); the former found it in 1953 and the latter generalized it in 1970 (remember: Generalization is a grand goal in science).
